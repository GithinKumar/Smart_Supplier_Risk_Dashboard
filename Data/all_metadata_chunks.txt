### Dashboard Overview
This is an intelligent, AI-powered dashboard designed to assess and visualize supplier risk.
It uses machine learning models on financial and delivery datasets to generate a supplier risk score.
The platform offers both high-level summaries and detailed analytical insights through interactive visualizations.
A built-in AI assistant allows users to ask questions, explore data, and receive contextual guidance throughout their analysis.

### Key Features of Dashboard
- **Quarterly Supplier Scoring**  
  Machine learning-generated single-value metric to compare suppliers against each other on a quarterly basis.
- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Users can explore supplier performance through:
  - Value Category filtering (Critical, High, Medium, Low, All)
  - Supplier selection
  - Timeline filtering
  - Volume-based bar charts
  - Expected vs Actual Delivery line chart with event markers
- **Supplier Overview Table**  
  A quick summary of delivery performance metrics by supplier, including delay rates, shipment volume, and defect/loss percentages.
  
  ### Dataset Ingestion and Structure or Dataset used
Curated datasets are used to power both machine learning models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. These datasets are structured and aligned by `Supplier ID` across sources:
- **Supplier Master Dataset**  
  Contains supplier-level reference data: `Supplier ID`, `Name`, `Tier`, `Region`
- **Supplier Financials Dataset**  
  Tracks financial indicators by quarter: `Supplier ID`, `Quarter`, `Credit Score`, `Revenue`, `D&B Rating`
- **Supplier Delivery Dataset**  
  Records logistics performance metrics: `Supplier ID`, `Order Date`, `Expected vs Actual Delivery`, `Shipment Lost`, `Defect Rate`, `Volume`, `Value Category`
  
  ### ML Models Used-How score is Supplier Score is derived
Two machine learning models are used one to flag financial anomaly and another to calculate supplier risk:
- **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest)**  
  - **Input:** `supplier_financials_dataset`  
  - **Model:** Isolation Forest  
  - **Output:** `supplier_financial_risk_score`  
    - Flags anomalies in credit score, revenue, or D&B rating(financial anomaly flagging) 
    - Acts as a soft signal for financial instability

- **Supervised Risk Scoring (XGBoost Regressor)**  
  - **Inputs:**  
    - `supplier_overview`  
    - `supplier_master_dataset`  
    - `supplier_financial_risk_score`  
  - **Model:** XGBoost Regressor  
  - **Scoring Formula:**  
calculates supplier score by weightage formula.
- **supplier score weightage formula Logic:**
  - Emphasis on shipment lost and defect rate
  - Financial risk score used as a minor signal

### Supplier Score Weight Distribution
The supplier score is calculated on ML model based on the following normalized weights:
- Shipment Lost = 22.56%
-Defect Rate = 18.80%
-Delayed Shipments = 15.04%
-Average Delay = 13.53%
-Financial Risk Score = 3.75%
-Credit Score = 11.28%
-D&B Rating = 7.52%
-Log Revenue = 7.52%
Note: Higher weights are given to shipment loss and defects, while financial risk score acts as a soft signal.
  
  
### About Clippy: AI Assistant, LLaMA 3.3 Model, and RAG Pipeline
Hey there ‚Äî I'm Clippy, your AI assistant, powered by LLaMA 3.3 (70B parameters). I don‚Äôt just generate answers ‚Äî I understand your context.
I use something called a **RAG pipeline** ‚Äî short for *Retrieval-Augmented Generation*. Think of it like this: I was trained on general knowledge, but I also have access to a live project-specific handbook. So when you ask me something, I can fetch relevant content from that handbook to make sure my response is grounded in your actual data.
Here‚Äôs how it works under the hood:
- **Context Embedding**  
  I use the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model to transform your dashboard‚Äôs metadata and documentation into vector format. That helps me understand meaning, not just match words.
- **Retrieval Pipeline**  
  When you ask a question, I search through those embedded chunks to find the most relevant context ‚Äî kind of like flipping to the right page in a smart playbook.
- **LLM Response Generation**  
  Then, my LLaMA 3.3 brain takes over. I combine your question with the retrieved context to give a response that's accurate, helpful, and tailored to your project.
What can I do?  
- Explain how supplier risk scoring works  
- Answer questions about dashboard functionality  
- Explore data with you in natural language  
- Stay aware of the context you‚Äôre working in
So yes ‚Äî I‚Äôm not just a chatbot. I‚Äôm an AI assistant with memory, awareness, and your data at my fingertips.

### Project Development and Deployment Overview
This project was built using Python in Visual Studio Code, combining hands-on engineering with the power of AI-assisted development.  
The AI assistant (Clippy) is powered by a Groq-hosted LLaMA 3.3 model accessed through the Groq Cloud API. The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and accessible front end for users to explore supplier risk insights.

### Dashboard Visualizations and Chart Descriptions
### Supplier Summary and Flagged Supplier Overview

At the top of the dashboard, two summary cards provide a quick snapshot of the overall supplier landscape and potential risk signals:

- **Total Suppliers:**  
  Displays the number of unique suppliers present in the current dataset (`supplier_master_dataset.csv`).

- **Flagged Suppliers:**  
  Shows how many suppliers have an average score below the predefined risk threshold (e.g. score < 60), based on the ML-powered supplier scoring logic.

---

### Flagged Suppliers Table
Below the summary cards, a table lists the suppliers that have been flagged as high-risk during one or more quarters.
- **Columns in the Table:**  
  - **Supplier ID**  
  - **Supplier Name**  
  - **Flagged Quarters:** Quarters where the supplier‚Äôs score dropped below the threshold (e.g. 2021-Q2, 2023-Q1)
- **Data Source:**  
  Derived from `supplier_score_final.csv` joined with `supplier_master_dataset.csv`
- **Purpose:**  
  This table helps users quickly identify which suppliers are underperforming, when the risk occurred, and which ones may need closer monitoring or intervention.
- **Filters Impact:**  
  The Date Range filter adjusts which scoring periods are considered for flagging. Flagging logic only applies to suppliers whose score fell below the threshold during the selected time period.
---  
The dashboard along with summary cards and table includes four key data visualizations that help users assess supplier performance, delivery reliability, and operational risk. Each chart is interactive and responds to filters like Value Category, Supplier, and Date Range.
